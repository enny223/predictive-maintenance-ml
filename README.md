# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

A machine learning project to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial machines using multivariate time-series sensor data. This project simulates predictive maintenance strategies that can prevent costly downtime.

## ?? Project Goals

- Predict time-to-failure (RUL) for turbofan engines using the NASA CMAPSS dataset
- Compare traditional ML models (e.g., XGBoost) with sequence models (e.g., LSTM)
- Build a reproducible and deployable ML pipeline
- Enable real-time predictions through a REST API or dashboard

## ?? Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-maintenance-ml.git
   cd predictive-maintenance-ml

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run notebooks or scripts inside the environment.

## ?? Key Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for deep learning)
- SHAP for model explainability
- Flask or Streamlit for deployment
- Git for version control

## ?? Project Highlights (Coming Soon)

- ?? Model performance metrics
- ?? SHAP visualizations
- ?? Live demo link (if deployed)

## ?? Status

?? Project in progress. Currently building baseline models and preparing deployment pipeline.
